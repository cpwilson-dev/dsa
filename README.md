# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Plan:

- Name: dsa (needs work)
- Idea: Build a SSG taking markdown notes, displaying in a TUI style. Include a fzf search similar to telescope.
- Time: 1 month
- Notes:
    - Design => https://wallenart.dev/
    - Theme => https://lawsofux.com/
    - Code Examples only in Python (for now)
    - FZF Search
    - Tree View


## TODO:

- Sprints:
    - Test with DSA notes
    - Test Github pages
    - Add Types to existing functions
    - Build out template and style sheets
    - Update markdown parser to create index & content
    - Integrate FZF search
    - Build out README

- Dailies:
    - Write up from DSA book

# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Plan:

- Name: dsa (needs work)
- Idea: Build a SSG taking markdown notes, displaying in a TUI style. Include a fzf search similar to telescope.
- Time: 1 month
- Notes:
    - Design => https://wallenart.dev/
    - Theme => https://lawsofux.com/
    - Code Examples only in Python (for now)
    - FZF Search
    - Tree View
